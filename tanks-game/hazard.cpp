other:
cloud (what would this do? spit out some powerups every now and then?) (it's *not* another lightning, that's for sure)
	(maybe it eats a bullet and spits out a powerup)
flag for capture the flag (base where the tank spawns; bringing it back gives godmode or something)
wall hazards (it's a wall, except it's a hazard) (dev purposes only)
magnetic hazard of some kind (when bullet or something is near it, shoots out some electricity (not lightning; there's a difference) and pulls it in)
