//level effect notes:
/*
multiple level effects can happen on the same level (can they interact with each other?)

list of (eventual) level effects:
|wall invisibility
|wind
|ice (no one really likes it, as expected)
|minefield
|respawning powerups
gravity/magnet (which is it?)

other:
respawning walls?
moving walls... of some sort
ultrafast shooting?
darkness?

I need more ideas for level effects...
