"complete" (wishlist, likely won't get here though)
* new game mode: infinite world!
    * single-player only
    * the point is just to explore
    * have fun!
* some unit tests?
* finish overhauling collision
    * maybe multithreading?
* lots of new stuff
* more random levels
* powerups:
    * sword
    * hazard powers?
    * megadeath update?
    * bouncing rework
        * something like bool applyBounceUpdate() to bulletpower?
    * fix respawning powerups working with magnetism level effect
        * level effects need a generic "do action on powerup/hazard/whatever"

0.2.6 (future)
* cross-platform!
* switched to GLFW from FreeGLUT
* multithreading option
    * performance doesn't really improve...
* render game in center of window (instead of bottom/left)
* added a window icon
* custom level playlist option
* allow swarm bullets to exist a little bit out of bounds
* gave spiral lava hazard a better color

0.2.5.1
* updated dependencies
* small performance improvements
* power duration setting
* fixed the diagnostics graph not updating collision time when the game ends or on window resizing

0.2.5 "done"
* rudimentary custom powers and levels!
    * turns out, DLLs were too complicated
    * look at the mods folder for examples
* ini file
    * allows for some customization
    * now it's possible to view certain levels/whatever that exist but aren't playable
* diagnostics graph: red for collision, green for vertex upload, blue for drawing, white for combined
* some documentation: very minimal, but at least there's now an easy-to-read list of everything in the game
* graphics: batched rendering
    * still not very efficient, but it's something
* mild QoL improvements to displaying things
    * tank multi-powers are more obvious
    * old tank death graphic (black to white gradient)
    * lightning hazards and no bullet zones are significantly easier to spot
    * sorry colorblind people, but powerups are still distinguishable by color only; would make sense to use an image instead, but that'll happen in a sequel
* overhaul collision: two passes for collision, more efficient
* correct delay between frames: previously 10ms from end of previous frame to start of new frame, now 10ms between start of frames (oops)
* powerups:
    * custom powers exist!
    * growing and degrading powerups mix better
    * option to make "extra cannons" (on triple and shotgun) behave like real cannons
    * swarm: bullets orbit around the tank (it's cool as heck)
    * [dev] backwards movement: by pressing the special key (currently e and /), the tank moves backwards
    * [dev] wall sparks and edge sparks: makes extra bullets when it hits a wall or edge (these are different powerups)
    * [dev] triple spread: the bullets spread out from the point they were shot at instead of being parallel
    * [dev] ring shooter: shoots a ring of 8 bullets; like multishot if everything shot the same direction
    * [dev] trickster: bullets move back and forth
* hazards:
    * patrolling turret: moves along its path
    * mother turret: creates turrets
    * ginormous turret: tells its turrets where to shoot
    * spiral lava: lava spirals out from center
    * gravity well: pulls in tanks and bullets
    * [dev] cloud: spits out powerups occasionally
    * [dev] reflecktor: bounces tanks
* levels:
    * custom levels exist!
    * "tight patrolling corridor"
    * "dangerous center"
    * "untraditional divider"
    * "terrifying chaos": a bit extreme of a name but there's terror and chaos
    * portal level, without the portals (just so every old level is present)
    * [dev] a bunch of unnamed levels: 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
        * decent ones: 4, 6, 9/10, 13
    * renamed "corridor" level back to "evened corridors" because I realized most levels followed the "adjective_noun" pattern
    * old versions of some levels ("evened corridors", "few obstacles", "hiding places")
    * moved "concealed powerups", "lightning corners", and "lone turret" levels out of vanilla because they are boring
* level effects:
    * magnetism (unfortunately doesn't work well with respawning powerups)
* minor things:
    * update to VS2022 and C++20
    * fullscreen toggle key changed to F11
    * *massive* cleanup across the entire project, multiple times; no seriously it was a lot
    * fix some long-standing memory leaks, oops
    * [dev] power, "ancient" megadeath: fires an accelerating, tracking, wallhacking bullet

0.2.4
* changed name from "Tanks" to "PowerTanks" so this game might actually become discoverable
* switch to 64-bit because no modern computer should be 32-bit
* made some changes to the renderer
    * will be better in a later version
* drawing layers: under, normal, effects, top, debug
* level effects added
    * all JS level effects in! (except portal)
        * wind, ice, minefield, invisible walls
        * portal and invisible walls technically weren't level effects in JS but should be counted as one
    * respawning powerups
        * likely very useful
* powerups:
    * all JS powers in!
        * mines, shotgun, tracking
        * barrier (previously called life)
    * shield (multi-hit barrier)
    * [dev] annoying: pushes tank away instead of killing it
    * [dev] ultrabounce: bounce bullets push away walls when bouncing
* levels:
    * all JS levels in! (except portal)
        * "hiding places" and "lone turret"
        * "lightning corners" (it was cut, but now it's back)
        * "winning path" (invisible level), "tricky maneuvering" (wind level), "mine heaven" (ice and mines level)
            * these levels didn't get names in JS...
    * "sneaky reward" (... this is actually my first true level in this version, wow)
    * "timed reward" (moving walls) (should be a dev level but I wanna show off the moving walls)
    * [dev] "nowall1": a test of a level without walls
    * [dev] "unnamed1" and "unnamed2": a generic level and a level with a zig-zag of walls
* minor things:
    * major cleanup (like massive cleanup, absolutely humongous, gigantically colossal)
        * replace x-comp, y-comp, angle variables with singular vector variable (fixed edge cases for things that need to detect angles)
    * [dev] level effect, symmetric tanks: forces tanks to have symmetric positions
    * minor overhaul (oxymoron?) of end game and score handling
    * inserting stuff through the dev "menu" is easier

0.2.3 "features"
* most things from JS Tanks in!!!
* powerups:
    * banana power!
    * godmode (still needs some work)
    * [dev] "inversion": switches turning direction of tank
* hazards:
    * all JS hazards in!
        * other lightning hazards (vertical, rectangle, circle)
        * no bullet zone (rectangular and circular)
        * targeting turret
    * hazard randomization
* level: "many hazards" (from JS Tanks)
* ability to weight levels, powers, and hazards when selecting them randomly
* minor things:
    * tankpower bullet attribute changes moved to bulletpowers (a moderate rewrite was needed)
    * a "special key" for tanks (does nothing right now)
    * visual cue for tank death, refactored handling of tank (and other) death
    * more cleanup
    * fullscreen toggle (press F1) (it's technically borderless fullscreen)
    * actually fixed homing power... whoops...

0.2.2.2
* two more levels to make the game less empty
    * I'm not very original, so they're from JS Tanks...
    * "few obstacles" and "concealed powerups"
* adding walls and powerups symmetrically to a level is now much easier

0.2.2.1
* cleanup
    * made levels function more like powerups (to a developer)
* homing power stopped working last version... it works now... whoops...

0.2.2
* horizontal lightning hazard
    * other lightning hazards will come later
* rectangular and circular lava hazards
* complete priority handling overhaul
* minor things:
    * levels and powerups can be grouped
    * a start towards a "game manager"
    * misc cleanup

0.2.1
* switched back to static vertex buffers
    * batching probably not possible in this state but I'll save that for another day
* better system for tankpowers adjusting tank values
* a few things moved out of main.cpp (mostly event handlers)
* big (and megadeath) bullet can destroy turrets

0.2.0
* all objects stream their vertices to VRAM
    * I was expecting a massive performance increase but got fewer frames and a VRAM spike (~4x worse performance)
    * batching is probably easier to implement now
* stationary turret shows its barrel

0.1.4 "gamify"
* actual levels used instead of only the developer level
    * ackchyually there were other levels in the game but they were only selectable if you changed a few lines
* other cleanup that makes developing easier:
    * constants file fixed up, now holds default constant values for things (stuff like tank radius and game width/height)
    * class managers (bullet, tank, hazard, key presses, etc.)
    * tick() separated into parts (not a big change but... cleanup!)
    * initialization stuff in main() cleaned up
* constants and speeds restored to faster JS settings because slow Tanks isn't fun Tanks
    * not all speeds are faster and not all are JS settings but it's better now

0.1.3
* hazards (no hazard powers yet)
* stationary turret mostly implemented
    * doesn't display its shooting angle

0.1.2.1
* added a fun level: only has simple powerups and big (fun with superfast shooting)
* big bullet size stacks (and other stuff can also stack)

0.1.2
* bullet acceleration (needs work)
* corridor level
* transparency in color is interpreted (not fully implemented) (also disabled now)
* powerups: grenade, fire, blast

0.1.1
* invincibility n' stuff (invincibility, big, megadeath)
* cleaned up how powers interacted

0.1.0
* rendering on GPU!
* lost the ability to draw tank names but that's okay

0.0.7.1
* cleanup for me (very little actual change)

0.0.7 and before
* primarily the framework and some powers to test the framework



sequel notes:
draw an image for powerups instead of just a color
arbitrary convex shapes for walls and hazards (would also allow spinning stuff) and arbitrary game world size
proper structure, built for unit testing and multithreading
AI and online play (intended LAN but theoretically anywhere, as long as the input buffer is configurable)
variable physics rate
consider SDL or SFML
