# PowerTanks Battle

The C++ upgrade of my [JavaScript game](https://uncreativeusername.neocities.org/tanks.html).

## Getting Started

(The video's small size is because GIFs don't have codecs for compression, and GitHub doesn't allow embedding MP4s...)

### Requirements

* OpenGL 3.3 or later
    * Earlier versions almost certainly work if you update the shaders (change `#version 330 core` to `#version 150 core` or [whatever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language#Versions))
    * Your GPU almost certainly supports this (yes, even if it's an ancient Thinkpad)
        * Apparently there are some Windows ARM laptops that only support DirectX, so those aren't supported
* 3GHz+ CPU recommended
    * Faster CPU -> more bullets on screen
    * Multithreading not available, too difficult (also I have basically no idea how to effectively multithreading RNG)
* ~200MB RAM
* No audio requirements, because there's no audio
* OS: Windows x64 or Linux x64
    * Mac OS dropped support for OpenGL when they switched to ARM, also I don't have a Mac to test on
    * ARM should be possible to support but I don't have an ARM device to test on

### Building (Windows)

1. Install Visual Studio 2022
1. Build x64 Release (on the solution, not project)
1. **[Pre-compiled executables](https://github.com/tanksdude/tanks-game/releases)** are provided if this isn't an option for you

### Building (Linux)

1. Prerequisites: a compiler and CMake: `sudo apt install build-essential cmake` (and maybe `git`)
1. GLFW and GLEW: `sudo apt install libglfw3-dev libglew-dev`
    * non-Debian systems currently untested
    * compiling these from source is currently unsupported, sorry
1. `mkdir build && cd build`
1. `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` (optional: `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-march=native -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-march=native`)
1. `make -j$(nproc)`
1. TODO: also needs `res/` and `tanks.ini` copied to the build dir

## Making custom levels

Making your own levels is now a thing! (Although the levels are very simple, and they take a while to make.) How to do so:

1. Navigate to the `mods` folder.
1. Add a new folder. This will be the name of your mod.
1. Add a `levels` folder to your mod's folder. Your custom levels go here.
1. Add some text files and make your custom levels!
1. Several fields need to be given. I suggest looking at one of the pre-made custom levels and copying it and modifying it.
1. Every level needs a `Name` (string), `Color` (3 floats in range [0,1] for RGB), `LevelTypes` (at least one string; recommended "modname" and "random-modname"), and `LevelWeights` (1 float for each type; recommended 1.0 is the base weight).
1. Optionally, levels can contain a `RandomStartPositionCount` (int, default = 5, for number of starting positions), `RandomStartPositionXValue` (float, default = 20, x-distance from edge), and `RandomStartPositionYRange` (float, default = 256=320-2*32, y-range for starting positions).
1. Once the assignments have been set, `[LEVEL_START]` needs to appear, then you can start adding walls and powers and stuff.
1. Look at `docs/custom-levels.md` for more information.

The custom level interpreter is very simple and barebones, so if you want to put something at the center, you have to put the coordinates as `320 160` instead of `GAME_WIDTH/2 GAME_HEIGHT/2`. Also you can't do any math to your numbers; they need to be the raw numbers (no "sqrt(3)" or "20*8", just "5" or whatever). I know this sucks but adding an expression parser is annoying [(although there is a popular library for this task)](https://github.com/ArashPartow/exprtk) and adding Lua (or maybe Python?) would've been a much larger hurdle [(although this Wikipedia list is much larger than the last time I looked at it so maybe it's easier than I thought?)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_applications_using_Lua).

## Making custom powers

Making your own powers is also now a thing! (Although very limited.) How to do so:

1. Follow the same steps as making custom levels, but add a `powers` folder in your mod's folder.
1. Every power needs a `Name` (string), `Color` (3 floats in range [0,1] for RGB), `PowerTypes` (at least one string; recommended "modname" and "random-modname"), and `PowerWeights` (1 float for each type; recommended 1.0 is the base weight).
1. Optionally, powers can contain a `PowerTankDurationMultiplier` (double, default = 1.0, for the duration the tank has the power) and `PowerAttributes` (strings, default = "stack" and "mix", just something to help when randomizing powers)
1. Once the assignments have been set, do `[TANKPOWER_START]` to set up the tank power, then `[BULLETPOWER_START]` to set up the bullet power.
1. Check the provided powers for syntax and stuff. They contain basically every operation currently available.
1. Look at `docs/custom-powers.md` for more information.

The custom power interpreter is also very simple and barebones.

## Running the tests

~~Will come soonâ„¢.~~

## Documentation

I didn't find a good way to easily build documentation, so... the documentation is quite lacking. However, there is some. Check the `docs` folder.

## Built With

* [Visual Studio (2022)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - C++ IDE from Microsoft
* [GFLW](https://www.glfw.org/) - OpenGL Framework (or Graphics Library Framework); cross-platform way to make windows and get inputs
* [GLEW](https://glew.sourceforge.net/) - OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library; for getting the latest OpenGL commands (where "latest" is >1.1)
* [OpenGL Mathematics (GLM)](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) - OpenGL-happy matrix and vector math library
* [rpmalloc](https://github.com/mjansson/rpmalloc) - Memory allocator, for some extra performance
* [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb) - Image loader for loading the window icon

## Contributing

This is my personal project so I won't be taking others' contributions. (Plus I've learned so much and would rather make a sequel at this point.) If you wanna do something with this project, you can fork this repository and do whatever you want.

## Acknowledgments

* JS Tanks (made by me): [tanks.html](https://uncreativeusername.neocities.org/tanks.html)
    * the JS version has significantly less stuff and way worse power mixing, so play this C++ version instead!
* Many people across the Interwebs who made StackOverflow and other forum posts
* Lots of YouTube tutorials, GDC talks, and my CS professors providing assistance
* The vague inspiration I had for this game back when I made it: some top-down Flash tank game. I've tried searching for it multiple times but have never found it, so given my continuously fading memories of that game I played, I'll probably never find out what it actually was. (No, it wasn't Wii Tanks (that's not a Flash game, come on!). I think the game had a more cartoonish than realistic artstyle. I don't remember if there were powerups. My closest guess was some old Atari game remade in Flash, but my searches didn't find anything useful.)
