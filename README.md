# Tanks: Battle of the Circles

The C++ upgrade of my JS game

## Getting Started

I don't really know what you need to get it running, so stay tuned

### Prerequisites

* If compiling from source, you'll want Visual Studio (2019)
    * pre-compiled executables will come soon if that's not an option for you
* Graphics card probably required
* OpenGL 3.3 or later
    * 3.2 or earlier might work if you update the shaders, but don't count on it
* 3GHz+ CPU recommended (2GHz is probably fine)
    * Single-core CPU is enough (because there's no multithreading)
* RAM requirements unknown, but at least 100MB
* No audio needed (unlikely to change in the future)
* Currently Windows-only (as far as I know) and 32-bit-only (64-bit Windows can run 32-bit programs)

### Installing

Install Visual Studio (2019) and the GitHub extension (I don't know if that's needed), then clone this project and run x86 Release (or Debug if you want to) (also make sure you're on the solution, not project)

I will provide pre-compiled executables soon

## Running the tests

Hahaha, nope.

Will need them eventually, though

## Built With

* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - C++ IDE from Microsoft
* [FreeGLUT](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/) - OpenGL Utility Toolkit; an updated version of the original GLUT
* [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) - OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library; for getting the latest OpenGL commands on Windows
* [OpenGL Mathematics (GLM)](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) - OpenGL-happy matrix and vector math library

## Contributing

Currently, and probably for however long I work on this project, I plan on working alone.

Once I've finished the underlying code I think I'll welcome new levels and powerups.

## Versioning

I do a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.HOTFIX versioning system, but it is generated by me, a human, so it's 100% subjective

(Also, 1.0.0 is "game finished," not "API is finalized")

## Acknowledgments

* JS game (made by me): [tanks.html](https://uncreativeusername.neocities.org/tanks.html)
* Many people across the Interwebs who made StackOverflow and other forum posts
* Lots of YouTube tutorials, GDC talks, and my CS professors providing assistance

## More acknowledgements

* [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject/videos) is very helpful for OpenGL
* [Solarian Programmer](https://solarianprogrammer.com/) has good starter code for hardware rendering
* [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/videos) is helpful, but wasn't *specifically* used for this project (probably was used for the JS game, but I don't remember)
* [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/)'s Friday Fun Facts are amazing and made me enjoy low-level C++ optimizations
* [Nitronic Rush](http://nitronic-rush.com/) is the other game that made me want to learn C++ in the first place
* [N++](http://www.nplusplus.org/) for just being a good game (also the developers had some [good GDC talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZ4xevskMCI) and have a fantastic game development blog)
