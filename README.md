# Tanks: Battle of the Circles

The C++ upgrade of my JS game

## Getting Started

I don't really know what you need to get it running, so stay tuned

### Prerequisites

You probably just need Visual Studio (2019) to get it running.

### Installing

\[TODO\]

```
temp
```

## Running the tests

Hahaha, nope.

Will need them eventually, though

## Deployment

dunno?

## Built With

* Visual Studio - it's VS, come on
* [FreeGLUT](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/) - OpenGL graphics toolkit

## Contributing

Currently, and probably for however long I work on this project, I plan on working alone. (Message me if you want to try something?)

## Versioning

I do a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH versioning system, but it is generated by me, a human, so it's 100% subjective to whatever I want

## Acknowledgments

* JS game (made by me): [tanks.html](https://uncreativeusername.neocities.org/tanks.html)
* Credited a few people for some functions (currently not true in the C++ game, but in the JS game)
* Lots of YouTube tutorials, StackOverflow, GDC, and my CS professors

## More acknowledgements

* [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject/videos) is very helpful for OpenGL
* [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/videos) is helpful, but wasn't *specifically* used for this project (probably was used for the JS game, but I don't remember)
* [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/)'s Friday Fun Facts are amazing and made me enjoy low-level C++ optimizations
* [Nitronic Rush](http://nitronic-rush.com/) is the other game that made me want to learn C++ in the first place
* [N++](http://www.nplusplus.org/) for just being a good game (also the developers had some good GDC talks)
