# Tanks: Battle of the Circles

The C++ upgrade of my JS game

## Getting Started

I don't really know what you need to get it running, so stay tuned
I'm pretty sure you just need a computer that can run Visual Studio (2019) and clone this project

### Prerequisites

Your computer must support Visual Studio (2019) and some OpenGL 2.0+ (stay tuned for what's actually needed)
I don't know how to make software rendering an option yet so you need a graphics card (or use a branch before v0.1.0, such as v0.0.7.1)
Single-core CPU is enough (for now)
No need for more than 100MB RAM
No audio needed (for now)
Currently Windows-only (probably)

### Installing

\[TODO\]

```
temp
```

Install Visual Studio (2019) and the GitHub extension (I don't know if that's needed), then clone this project and run x86 Debug (or Release if you want to) (also make sure you're on the solution, not project)

## Running the tests

Hahaha, nope.

Will need them eventually, though

## Deployment

dunno?

## Built With

* Visual Studio - it's VS, come on
* [FreeGLUT](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/) - OpenGL graphics toolkit
* [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) - OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library

## Contributing

Currently, and probably for however long I work on this project, I plan on working alone. (Message me if you want to try something?)

## Versioning

I do a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.HOTFIX versioning system, but it is generated by me, a human, so it's 100% subjective

## Acknowledgments

* JS game (made by me): [tanks.html](https://uncreativeusername.neocities.org/tanks.html)
* Credited a few people for some functions (currently not true in the C++ game, but in the JS game)
* Lots of YouTube tutorials, StackOverflow, GDC, and my CS professors

## More acknowledgements

* [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject/videos) is very helpful for OpenGL
* [Solarian Programmer](https://solarianprogrammer.com/) has good starter code for hardware rendering
* [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/videos) is helpful, but wasn't *specifically* used for this project (probably was used for the JS game, but I don't remember)
* [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/)'s Friday Fun Facts are amazing and made me enjoy low-level C++ optimizations
* [Nitronic Rush](http://nitronic-rush.com/) is the other game that made me want to learn C++ in the first place
* [N++](http://www.nplusplus.org/) for just being a good game (also the developers had some good GDC talks and have a fantastic game development blog)
